# The Cosmic Calendar - API

> An API to access the basic information about Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar

If you would like to see the client side I built, the GitHub page is [here](https://github.com/brandonb81/The-Cosmic-Calendar-Client)

### What was used for the build

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
- [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/)

### What inspired me to build this?

> I wanted to build an interactive web app for Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar, but after a lot of searching I found plenty of information and no way to access it for the project I wanted to create.  So I gathered all the basic information and decided it was best to build my own API to make this happen.

### What's next for this API?

> 1. I'd love to expand the data and build up the API so that anyone could, and want, to use it for whatever projects they'd like.
2. I hope to integrate testing soon to make it more stable.
